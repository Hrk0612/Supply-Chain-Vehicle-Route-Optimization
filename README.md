# Supply-Chain-Vehicle-Route-Optimization
Overview
This project implements a Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) solution for the Indian agri-food supply chain network. The system optimizes the collection of agricultural products from geographically dispersed farmers to distribution hubs, minimizing total transportation costs.

Key Objectives:
Minimize transportation costs from farmers to hubs
Optimize vehicle routing between farmer locations
Reduce operational expenses for farmers
Improve supply chain efficiency

Problem Statement
Current Challenges:
  50%+ of Indian workforce in agriculture sector
  30% of total costs incurred in distribution
  Unorganized transportation leading to high costs
  Geographically dispersed individual farmers
  Poor profit margins for farmers

Solution Approach:
  Implement optimized vehicle routing from hubs to farmers using meta-heuristic algorithms to:
  Form optimal travel routes
  Pool products from multiple farmers
  Minimize transportation and operational costs
  Satisfy all supply-demand constraints
